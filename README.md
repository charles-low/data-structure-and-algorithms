# Data structure and algorithm

Inspired by leetcode, this repo contains simple data structure implementation in C. 
The purpose of doing this is to practice my long gone coding skills, and get deeper understanding of data structure and algorithms. Also playing around with Makefile and ability to compile everything on Linux / MacOS aarch64 (this is not as easy as it appears to be).

## Current status

1. linkedlist - doubly linked list allow any type of data to be stored
2. hashtable - simple hashtable implementation use int as key and value. 
   - resize and rehash mechanism yet to be implemented.

## What's next (probably)

1. binary search tree
2. trie
