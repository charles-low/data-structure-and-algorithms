# Data structure and algorithm

Inspired by leetcode, this repo contains simple data structure implementation in C. 
The purpose of doing this is to practice my long gone coding skills, and get deeper understanding of data structure and algorithms. Also playing around with Makefile and ability to compile everything on Linux / MacOS aarch64 (this is not as easy as it appears to be).
